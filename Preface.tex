This is a log book for amateur astronomers intending to observe the
Messier objects.

The book's content and structure is inspired by the Bangalore
Astronomical Society's (\url{http://bas.org.in}) Messier certification
program.

This is a compilation of observation log forms for each of the 110
Messier objects accompanied by useful information about the object, a
star chart, and an image from the Digitized Sky Surveys. It may gain
more features as time progresses
