This is a log book for amateur astronomers intending to observe the
Messier objects.

The book's content and structure is inspired by the Bangalore
Astronomical Society's (\url{http://bas.org.in}) Messier certification
program.

This is a compilation of observation log forms for each of the 110
Messier objects accompanied by useful information about the object, a
star chart, and an image from the Digitized Sky Surveys. It may gain
more features as time progresses

Note that the magnitudes displayed for the nebulae M 43, M 78, M 20, M
8 and M 17 are blue magnitudes (as opposed to visual magnitudes) from
Dr. Wolfgang Steinicke's revised NGC/IC catalog, so the objects may
appear brighter to the eye than the magnitudes actually indicate.

Hope you have fun observing these objects!
