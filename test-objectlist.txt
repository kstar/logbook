M 4|A low surface brightness, but well resolved globular cluster. Might be easier to locate with binoculars than with a telescope. Stars resolved even in small telescopes.|B CB CT
M 5|A bright globular cluster.|B CT
M 6|With a telescope, try to observe the butterfly pattern of stars that gives this cluster its name.|CB CT B N
M 17|Messier 17 -- but imaginary naked eye visibility from the city for testing.|CT B N CN CB
M 7|A remarkable cluster with few bright stars. Can be viewed with the naked eye from city skies at times.|CB CT B CN N
M 110|The fainter companion of M 31. Binoculars may be able to discern this. M 110 appears more distant from M 31 in telescopes than in photographs because outer parts of M 31 are rather low surface brightness and are not seen easily. See also M 32.|B
