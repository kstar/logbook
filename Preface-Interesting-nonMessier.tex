This is a log book for observers wanting to see some of the
interesting (not necessarily bright) non-Messier (mostly NGC and IC)
objects in the sky. Some of these objects need very dark skies to
observe. Some of these have not been observed by the author of the
descriptions, and these objects have just been chosen from an internet
source.

This is a compilation of observation log forms for each of the objects
accompanied by useful information about the object, 3 star charts, and
an image from the Digitized Sky Surveys. It may gain more features as
time progresses.

The objects were hand-picked for observers in the northern
hemisphere. Thus, deep southern hemisphere objects are missing, except
for some that are visible close to the horizon from latitudes around
$13\circdegree$ N.

The book's content and structure is inspired by the Bangalore
Astronomical Society's (\url{http://bas.org.in}) observer
certification programs. The idea for this particular logbook came from
Mr. Naveen Nanjundappa.

I hope you will enjoy observing these objects!
