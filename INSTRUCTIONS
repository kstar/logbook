A very rough set of instructions on how to use this project.

1. Install the dependencies:

* KStars (only the current git master works as of this writing, and
  still segfaults often enough)
* ImageMagick
* xmlstarlet
* pdflatex
* inkscape
* pdftk
* qdbus
* wget

Some additional TeX packages may be necessary. Please update this
document if missing dependencies are found.

2. Create an object list file and a config file. See the comments in
   generate-logbook.sh and the existing .cfg and .txt files for help.
   
   TODO: Explain the object list file.

3. Backup and replace your KStars configuration file (kstarsrc in
   $HOME/.kde/share/config) and the NGC/IC data file (ngcic.dat in
   $HOME/.kde/share/apps/kstars) with the supplied files. Also copy
   logbook-colors.colors color scheme, which has been tested for
   grayscale and color printing, and viewing under red light.

4. Run KStars, make sure exporting SVG images works without
   segfaulting. Make sure KStars is accessible over DBus.

5. Resize the KStars window to a good size. Some favourite sizes are
   mentioned in Working-Window-Sizes.txt

6. Run the script. See the comments in the script file for invokation
   details.

7. Go do something else while the script finishes, careful not to
   close the KStars window.

8. Tend to errors, if any.

9. The final PDF output should be Output.pdf in the project
   directory. The build/ subdirectory contains build stuff. Make sure
   you don't push it back onto the repositories. There must be a
   gitignore that prevents this already.
