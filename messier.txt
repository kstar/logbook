M 31|Our remarkable galactic neighbour appears majestically to the naked eye from a dark site. In city conditions, it may be hard to see more than the central high-surface brightness core.|B CB CT N
M 32|Has about the same surface-brightness as the core of M31. Appears detached from M 31 in most telescopes, because the faint parts of M31 are too faint to be seen. To avoid confusion with M 110, note that this M 32 is drastically easier to see, and if you see something nearly as bright as M 31's core, it is most definitely M 32 and not M 110.|CT
M 33|A low surface brightness, but remarkable face-on spiral galaxy! While it is nearly impossible from city skies, binoculars will easily show it from a dark site. Visible to the naked eye under good sky conditions. Shows spiral structure even in $4'' \sim 6''$ telescopes. Look out for nebula NGC 604 in M33. |B N

M 43|A comma shaped, fainter nebulosity around a star, just ``above'' (imagining Orion standing erect) the Trapezium, separated from M 42 by a streak of darkness. Might need darkish skies.|

M 109|Competing with M 74 for the faintest of the Messier catalog, especially from lower latitudes, this barred spiral galaxy needs dark skies. But from dark skies, you can discern the bar fairly easily with 8'' of aperture.|
M 110|The fainter companion of M 31. Binoculars may be able to discern this. Larger binoculars are better. This appears rather removed from M 31 in telescopes than in the photographs because the outer parts of M 31 are rather low surface brightness and are not seen easily through a telescope. See also the description for M 32.|B
