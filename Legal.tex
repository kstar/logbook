\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{You may not use this compilation for commercial / profit-making
  purposes!}  This is because this compilation uses images from the
  Digitized Sky Surveys. Please see

\section*{Data Sources and Copyrights}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Images} from the \emph{Digitized Sky Survey} used in
  this compilation come from the \emph{POSS II} (Northern Hemisphere)
  and \emph{UKSTU} (Southern Hemisphere) surveys. The following
  copyright statement is found on the DSS access portal at the STScI,
  USA
  (\url{http://gsss.stsci.edu/Acknowledgements/DataCopyrights.htm})

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{POSS-II Northern Hemisphere Surveys} -- The compressed
      files of the ``Palomar Observatory - Space Telescope Science
      Institute Digital Sky Survey'' of the northern sky, based on
      scans of the Second Palomar Sky Survey are copyright (c)
      1993-2003 by the California Institute of Technology and are
      distributed herein\footnote{i.e. at the MAST website:
        \url{http://archive.stsci.edu/}} by agreement. All Rights
      Reserved.
    \item \emph{Southern Hemisphere Surveys observed prior to 1993} --
      Southern Hemisphere Surveys were made with the UK Schmidt
      Telescope at the Anglo-Australian Observatory. Plates from these
      surveys have been digitized and compressed by the STScI. The
      digitized images are copyright (c) 1976-1993, jointly by the UK
      SERC/PPARC (formerly Science and Engineering Research
      Council/Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council, and
      currently the Science and Technology Facilities Council), and
      are distributed herein by agreement. All Rights
      Reserved. Represented by the Wide Field Astronomy Unit at the
      Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE).
    \item \emph{Southern Hemisphere Surveys observed since 1993} --
      The ``Second Epoch Survey'' of the southern sky was made by the
      Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) with the UK Schmidt
      Telescope. Plates from this survey have been digitized and
      compressed by the STScI. The digitized images are copyright (c)
      1993-2004 by the Anglo-Australian Observatory Board, and are

  In complying with the DSS copyright policy, the creator of this

  \textbf{non-profit purposes}.

\item \textbf{Star Catalog Data} used in the star charts come from
  three major catalogs: \emph{Hipparcos}, \emph{Tycho 2}, and
  \emph{USNO NOMAD} and rendered using \emph{KStars}.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Hipparcos} and \emph{Tycho 2} were obtained from the
      Astronomical Data Center run by the NASA. While the data center
      is now closed, at the time of download, the website said:

      ``All ADC data are public domain unless otherwise stated in the
      ``ReadMe'' file. The data are for scientific use only and have
      no commercial value.''

      As of January 2013, an archive of the old website is still
      accessible here:
      \url{http://web.archive.org/web/20060908091808/http://adc.astro.umd.edu/adc/questions_feedback.html#policies1}

    \item \emph{USNO NOMAD} was obtained from the US Naval Observatory
      (\url{http://www.nofs.navy.mil/nomad/}).

      The ``Privacy and Security Notice'' on USNO's website
      (\url{http://ad.usno.navy.mil/privacy.shtml}) reads:

      ``All information presented on these pages is considered public
      domain and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise
      specified. Use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is
      requested.''

      No explicit statement is made about the NOMAD catalog in
      particular.
  \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Deep-Sky Object Data} used in the star charts come from
  the (old) KStars NGC/IC catalog (constructed by Jason Harris and
  released under the GNU General Public License) and the Saguaro
  Astronomy Club catalog by Steve Coe.

  The author of this compilation obtained explicit permission for the
  catalog's data to be used in KStars from Mr. Steve Coe, using which
  the star charts were rendered.
